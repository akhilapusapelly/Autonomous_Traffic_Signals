# Autonomous Traffic Signals

In this project, the model autonomously selects four images representing traffic in four lanes without user input. Each image is then individually processed to determine the number of vehicles present in its respective lane. Subsequently, the model assigns the green signal to the lane with the highest vehicle count. Following this initial assignment, the remaining lanes receive the green signal based on the density of vehicles within each lane, ensuring efficient traffic flow across all lanes.

1. Uploading 4 Images
2. Model calculated the Vehicle Density
3. Model starts the signaling
4. This repeats for 10 times.
